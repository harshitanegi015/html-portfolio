<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Harshita Negi, a passionate BTech CSE student with a creative soul and a curious mind. I love bringing ideas to life on the web, whether it's through clean code or thoughtful design.</p>

<p>My journey in tech started with a simple interest in how websites work â€” and now, I'm learning to build them from scratch! I'm especially drawn to front-end development and love creating beautiful, user-friendly interfaces.</p>

<p>Beyond tech, I enjoy reading, designing digital art, and exploring new tools that help express creativity. Whether it's building a portfolio or experimenting with colors, I'm always excited to learn and grow.</p>

<p>I'm currently focused on improving my web development skills and building a strong foundation in both design and development. My goal is to become a confident, full-stack developer and contribute to projects that make a difference.</p>
