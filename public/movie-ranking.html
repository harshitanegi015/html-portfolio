 <p>I love how Katniss stands up for what's right and how the story blends survival, rebellion, and emotion in a gripping way.</p>
 <h3>Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince</h3>

 <p>I'm drawn to the darker tone, the emotional depth, and how it reveals the secrets behind Voldemort's rise.</p>
 <h3>The Maze Runner</h3>

 <p>I enjoy the suspense, fast-paced action, and the mystery of the maze that keeps you guessing till the end.</p>
